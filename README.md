# My-Vegetable-Garden-Trello-Project
Welcome to my **first Trello project**!   I used **Trello** to plan, track, and organize the process of creating my own vegetable garden.   This project was my first step into learning **project management tools** and applying them in real life.  

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project was to manage all the activities involved in **building and maintaining a vegetable garden**.  
Trello helped me stay organized and made the entire process fun and productive.

## ✅ What I Did in Trello
- 🥕 Created task lists for **planting, watering, fertilizing, and harvesting**  
- 🌱 Added **checklists** to make sure daily tasks were not missed  
- 🍅 Used **labels** (priority tags) for tasks like *High*, *Medium*, *Low*  
- 📸 Attached **photos** of progress to track plant growth  
- ⏰ Added **due dates and reminders** to stay on schedule  
- 📊 Monitored overall progress visually through Trello boards
