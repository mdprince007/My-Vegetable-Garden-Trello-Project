# My-Vegetable-Garden-Trello-Project
Welcome to my **first Trello project**!   I used **Trello** to plan, track, and organize the process of creating my own vegetable garden.   This project was my first step into learning **project management tools** and applying them in real life.  

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project was to manage all the activities involved in **building and maintaining a vegetable garden**.  
Trello helped me stay organized and made the entire process fun and productive.  



## ✅ What I Did in Trello
✨ **Key Features of My Board:**  
- 🥕 **Task Lists** → Planting, Watering, Fertilizing, Harvesting
